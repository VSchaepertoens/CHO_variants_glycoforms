## 1. Relative quantification of intact mAb and mAb subunits (light chain, light chain dimer, heavy-chain dimer)

In order to assess differences in mAb subunits of the drug product between the different CHO-cell variants, we performed relative quantification of peak areas from UV-chromatograms.

## 2. Quantification of glycans found on the intact level - corrected for hexose bias

In order to assess differences between the composition and the abundance of N-linked glycans on the drug product of the different CHO-cell variants, we quantified the fractional abundances from the raw MS spectra. For a precise analysis of only the intact drug product and not any of the subunits, only scans between retention-time (RT) 273±1 seconds and 277±1 seconds were used for the quantification. Because some drug products contained C-terminal lysine modifications while others did not, we enzymatically removed lysine variants from all samples using carboxypeptidase B (CPB), as part of the preanalytical workflow. Due to the isobaricity of galactose and glucose, we quantified hexose bias in the drug product samples due to the attachment of glucose (section 2.1) and corrected the resulting N-glycans dataset accordingly.

To fully appreciate the differences between N-glycans abundances, we transformed the data by calculating the z-score for each glycan across all samples. 
$$
z = (x - μ) / σ
$$ where, x = fractional abundance of a sample, $μ$ = mean , $σ$ = standard deviation

A z-score of zero indicates that the glycan's abundance is the same as the mean abundance level across all samples, while a positive z-score indicates that the glycan is more abundant than the mean, and a negative z-score indicates that the glycan is less abundant than the mean.

## 2.1 Hexose bias - Quantification of glycation found on the intact level

To quantify the level of glycation in CHO-cell variants samples, we performed a two-step pre-analytical enzymatic digestion. First, we removed C-terminal lysine variants using CPB, and second, we removed N-linked glycans by PNGase F digest. The resulting MS spectra, corresponding to RT 274±1 seconds and 279±2 seconds, were used for the quantification of glycation in the different CHO-cell variant samples.

## 3. Quantification of glycans found on  heavy-chain dimer levels 

In the drug product samples from CHO-cell variants A19 and A16, the elution of heavy chain dimer a couple of seconds later than the intact drug product peak allowed for quantification of N-linked glycans at this subunit level. For a precise analysis of only the heavy chain dimer and not the intact drug product, only scans between retention-time (RT) 279 seconds and 282 seconds were used for the quantification. In order to compare the differences between the abundances of N-glycans on the intact level versus the ones which were quantified at the heavy chain level, we recalculated the intact level fractional abundances of only glycoforms found on the HC level and plotted this data separately.

## 4. Charge variants - Quantification of lysine variants found on intact and heavy chain dimer levels

To quantify C-terminal lysine variants present in the CHO-cell variant drug product, we enzymatically removed N-glycans by using PNGase F treatment. Such chemical treatment produces a drug product free of N-glycans, while keeping other modifications such as C-terminal lysine and glycation intact. We quantified both modifications on MS spectra at the intact level with RT 271±0.8 - 277±2.3 seconds and at the level of the heavy chain dimer with RT 277±0.1 - 283±0.8 seconds.
