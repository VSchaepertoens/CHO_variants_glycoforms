## Folders

(Not all of these folders appear in the gitHub repository.)

-   `data`: raw input files and tables
-   `analysis`: output tables generated by the scripts in this repository
-   `figures`: plots generated by the plotting scripts
-   `mab_sequence`: fasta file containing the sequence of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) trastuzumab

## Analysis description

Please use R version 4.3.0. This repository contains scripts for the following analysis:

1.  Quantification of the mAb subunits from the peak areas of UV-chromatograms

    -   Input: data/RelQuantIntact01.csv

    -   Script: [plot_subunits.R](plot_subunits.R) - Loads csv table with the subunits quantification and plots stacked barplot.

    -   Output: Saves stacked barplot figure_8.png in the folder `figures`

2.  Quantification and hexose bias correction of N-glycans attached to the Fc region of the mAb

    2.1 Quantification of hexose-bias uncorrected N-glycans abundance 
    
    Download intact_input_data.zip from the Zenodo repository and unzip the raw and mzml files into the `data` directory. Also download the csv table which contains information on retention times, the MS scan numbers and the charge states (rt_seconds_Jan2024_cs42_53_intact.csv) into the `data` directory.

    -   Input: all mzml files in the directory `data`, data/rt_seconds_Jan2024_cs42_53_intact.csv

    -   Script : [analyse_all_files.R](analyse_all_files.R) - Using the package [fragquaxi](https://github.com/cdl-biosimilars/fragquaxi), quantify N-glycans in the input mzml files

    -   Output: Each mzml file will have the quantified table saved into a folder with the file name, e.g. analysis/20240125_TB_A2_1_CpB_11/frac_ab_tb_cs50.csv

    2.2 Quantification of hexose bias
    
     Download pngase_cpb_input_data.zip from the Zenodo repository and unzip the raw and mzml files into the `data` directory. Also download the csv table which contains information on retention times, the MS scan numbers and the charge states (rt_seconds_Jan2024_pngase.csv) into the `data` directory.

    -   Input: all mzml files in the directory `data`, data/rt_seconds_Jan2024_pngase.csv

    -   Script : [analyse_all_files_pngase.R](analyse_all_files_pngase.R) - Using the package [fragquaxi](https://github.com/cdl-biosimilars/fragquaxi), quantify hexoses in the input mzml files

    -   Output: Each mzml file will have the quantified table saved into a folder with the file name, e.g. analysis/20240125_TB_A16_1_CpB_PNGase_111/frac_ab_tb_cs50.csv

    2.3 Correction of hexose bias and final quantification of corrected N-glycans abudance

3.  Quantification of lysine variants and glycation on the intact mAb
